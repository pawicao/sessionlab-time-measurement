# SessionLab time measurement
## Measuring facilitators' delivery time

A browser extension for the SessionLab website. It calculates the time of delivery for each facilitator.

### Installation

WIP

### How to use it

Just go into the **Info** tab on the right and the updated time should be there!
In case something goes wrong and the updates don't reoccur due to collaboration on the session in real time,
just hit the refresh button right next to the time division.

Enjoy and happy deliveries!
